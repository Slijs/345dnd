# 345dnd
Group assignment for comp 345 dungeons and dragons.

**For assignment 1, use the branch Assignment1**

How to git:

1. Accept the invite to collaborate

2. Go to the folder that you'll want our project to be in and clone our project. You'll need to input your Github username and password:
`git clone https://github.com/Slijs/345dnd.git`

3. Go into the newly created folder *345dnd* and switch to the **Assignment1** branch:
`git checkout Assignment1`

4. Do changes in the appropriate folder. Whenever you've made a specific change, commit it with a relevant message. Commit often! This will help us later if we need to go back and revert or if something breaks.

5. Add all files that you want to commit. Either 
`git add *` or `git add FILE_TO_ADD.ext`

6. Commit these files to git:
`git commit -m "Relevant message here"`

7. Push to github:
`git push`
