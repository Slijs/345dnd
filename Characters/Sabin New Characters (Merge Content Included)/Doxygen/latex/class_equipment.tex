\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is a dummy class to implement equipments. All equipment have names but each type of equipment has different affects on character stats depending on the type of equipment and bonus types they implement.

All armors inherit from \hyperlink{class_equipment}{Equipment} and have an A\+C\+Bonus.

All shields inherit from Armors since they also only have an A\+C\+Bonus.

All weapons inherit from \hyperlink{class_equipment}{Equipment} and have a dieroll and a type (melee or ranged)

All boots inherit from \hyperlink{class_equipment}{Equipment} and have a bonustype and a bonus value. Bonustypes are as follows\+: 0 = N\+O\+NE, 1 = D\+EX, 2 = AC

All helmets inherit from \hyperlink{class_boots}{Boots} and also have a bonustype and bonus value. Bonustypes are as follows\+: 0 = N\+O\+NE, 1 = I\+NT, 2 = W\+IS, 3 = AC

All rings inherit from \hyperlink{class_boots}{Boots} and also have a bonustype and bonus value. Bonustypes are as follows\+: 0 = N\+O\+NE, 1= S\+TR, 2 = C\+ON, 3 = W\+IS, 4 = C\+HA, 5 = AC

N\+O\+TE\+: name is set to \char`\"{}\+N\+O\+N\+E\char`\"{} when using the default constructor. Therefore, to de-\/equip, simply call the default constructor of any equipment type. This will set all values to 0 or empty string.
