* Welcome to our game! We have worked very hard to create an enjoyable experience which implements all features that are required.
*<p><b>TO PLAY:</b>
*<p> Select the appropriate option from the main menu, then select your campaign and player. Upon setup, the game will decide which character
* on the map gets to go first. All characters will go in order until it is your turn.
*<p> On your turn, you are able to perform up to two actions, composed of any combination of attacking and moving. The distance you can move depends
* upon the speed of your character, which comes from its race.
*<p> Movement is allowed to the LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, and all diagional directions. To move, select "Move" from the menu and click on the square you want
* to move to. If you would like to move a second time, feel free to do so.
*<p> To stop movement, right-click on the mouse. A new selection can then be made on the menu.
*<p> To attack enemies, select "Attack" from the menu, and then click on the enemy you would like to attack. The log will display information regarding whether
* or not your attack was successful.
*<p> NOTE: If you attack a friendly character, they will get angry and start attacking you back!
*<p> To stop attacking, simply right-click on the mouse.
*<p> In addition to movement, you are also able to equip/dequip and interact with the environment as much as you way. To open a chest, select "Interact" from the menu
* and click on the chest you want to open. If you empty the chest, it will disappear from the map; if there are still items in it after you iteract with it, it will
* not disappear.
*<p> Once you have performed your two actions for the round, you must end your turn before gameplay continues.
*<p> The objective for each level is to get to the door without dying. If you make it through all the maps in the campaign, you <b>win!</b>
