Welcome to our game! We have worked very hard to create an enjoyable experience which implements all features that are required. 

{\bfseries TO P\+L\+AY\+:} 

Select the appropriate option from the main menu, then select your campaign and player. Upon setup, the game will decide which character on the map gets to go first. All characters will go in order until it is your turn. 

On your turn, you are able to perform up to two actions, composed of any combination of attacking and moving. The distance you can move depends upon the speed of your character, which comes from its race. 

Movement is allowed to the L\+E\+FT, R\+I\+G\+HT, UP, D\+O\+WN, and all diagional directions. To move, select \char`\"{}\+Move\char`\"{} from the menu and click on the square you want to move to. If you would like to move a second time, feel free to do so. 

To stop movement, right-\/click on the mouse. A new selection can then be made on the menu. 

To attack enemies, select \char`\"{}\+Attack\char`\"{} from the menu, and then click on the enemy you would like to attack. The log will display information regarding whether or not your attack was successful. 

N\+O\+TE\+: If you attack a friendly character, they will get angry and start attacking you back! 

To stop attacking, simply right-\/click on the mouse. 

In addition to movement, you are also able to equip/dequip and interact with the environment as much as you way. To open a chest, select \char`\"{}\+Interact\char`\"{} from the menu and click on the chest you want to open. If you empty the chest, it will disappear from the map; if there are still items in it after you iteract with it, it will not disappear. 

Once you have performed your two actions for the round, you must end your turn before gameplay continues. 

The objective for each level is to get to the door without dying. If you make it through all the maps in the campaign, you {\bfseries win!}
